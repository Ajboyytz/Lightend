Hey, this is really simple to use just put the html code in any online html editor(https://www.onlinehtmleditor.net/) is the one i recommend.

step 1 - copy this code, if github is blocked you can go here -  - https://jsfiddle.net/jn1460y8/latest/#&togetherjs=tMu76Hsxhy or  https://codeshare.io/8X88Yv(view only mode is off so beaware of hackers)

step 2 - just follow the instructions

P.S. A huge part of this is possible due to Blobby-Boi thank him :D
